# Zsh Config (modular, macOS-friendly)

This repository contains a **modular, modern, and clean zsh configuration** using [`Oh My Zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/) and [`zinit`](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit). It is optimized for **macOS**, and integrates a curated set of tools for better CLI productivity.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/zsh-config.git ~/.zsh-config
```

2. **Link the main config file**:

```bash
ln -sf ~/.zsh-config/zshrc ~/.zshrc
```

3. **Restart your terminal** (or `source ~/.zshrc`)

> \[!NOTE]
> This setup assumes that tools like `fzf`, `bat`, `ripgrep`, etc. will be automatically handled and updated via `zinit`. Nerd Font is required.

![bat](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a9789c5200bdb0a22602643d7bf85f0f424ddd4259e763abc865609010c5e228/68747470733a2f2f696d6775722e636f6d2f724773646e44652e706e67)

### [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck)

> `thefuck` is a command line tool that corrects previous console commands. It analyzes the last failed command and suggests a fix. Just type `fuck` to apply it.

Example:

```sh
$ sl
zsh: command not found: sl
$ fuck
Did you mean: sudo ls [enter/â†‘/â†“/ctrl+c]
```

In this configuration, `thefuck` is automatically initialized with:

```sh
eval "$(thefuck --alias)"
```

> \[!NOTE]
> To work correctly, `thefuck` needs to be installed via Homebrew or pip:
>
> ```sh
> brew install thefuck
> # or
> pip install thefuck
> ```

---

## ðŸ”„ Update everything

To update all binaries installed by Zinit:

```sh
zinit update --parallel
```
